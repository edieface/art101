		<h1>Lab 11: Libraries and jQuery</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p>This week's challenge was to experiment with jQuery.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I got rather stuck on the initial jQuery website, and couldn't find the initial download option, or how to really experiment on the browser. I became confused, and I need to go back and review the lecture.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>I think I've figured out what exactely I need to do in order to succeed in the course, and identified the problems I've been facing in order to go about solving them. The next step is to really tamp down and fix all the problems.</p>
