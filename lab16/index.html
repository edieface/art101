		<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p>This week's challenge was to use JSON and APIs</h2>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> I thought that working on this lab at the same time as lab 15 would help me understand better, but I'm still pretty lost :( </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>I was unable to get things to come together, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the theory and what's supposed to happen.</p>
