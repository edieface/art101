		<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p>This week we had to experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</h2>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be accomplishing with this lab... How do I manipulate jQuery and AJAX? Again, I'm kind of confused by the conjunction between the assignment and the lecture material, I find it very challenging.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>I have to look this up and try to figure this out so I can apply the knowledge to my final project.</p>
