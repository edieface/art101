		<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p>This week was to create a function with conditionals.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My partners and I were challenged to create our buttons and make things work with connecting the JS with the rest of the program.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>After lecture and section I was still confused about this, so I'm going to review again and try to resubmit.</p>
