		<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p>This week's challenge was debugging our old labs.</h2>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My issue with this lab is that I'm not really sure where to begin... I suppose in order to learn how to debug you need to know what you got wrong, or how you made mistakes. The problem is I don't know how my labs are wrong. When I check the JavaScript console there's always 1-2 punctuation points out of synch, but I don't understand how to correct it. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>I went through all the labs again, and though I couldn't make a lot of progress I'll go back and do further research on how to fix my problems. </p>
