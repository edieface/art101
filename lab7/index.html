		<h1>Lab 7: Functions </h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p> For this lab I worked with Kayla and Amelia to write functions that accept a user input and manipulate strings.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Linking to my JavaScript file in the index.html file was still challenging for me, and I'm going to ask my partners for assistance.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>I was able to make my lab appear in the right place on my home page, but linking to the JavaScript was not easy.</p>
