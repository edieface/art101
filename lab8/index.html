		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p>Working with Kayla and Amelia we are making anonymous functions and callbacks</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had an issue finding my js function but then I reread the lab and found it in the console!</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>I figured it out! Except I'm still having issues with the css, and integrating style sheets into my webpage... I'll have to work on that... Also, I tried Task X but I couldn't figure it out.</p>

		<div id="output">
			var outputE1 = document.getElementById ("output");
			outputE1.innerHTML = mapResults;
