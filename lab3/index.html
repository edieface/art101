		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>This lab is foccused on file structures. </p>
		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p> I struggled with uploading pictures to the folder, as well as how to create an organized structure. None of my images showed up :( </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>It's been hard toggling back and forth between my browser and atom on a local level, so I just hope this looks okay.</p>
