		<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web.</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p>We worked on creating elements and assigning them attributes in JavaScript and combine with CSS in our html file.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I was struggling to create and assign attributes and come up with the necessary functions to perform the tasks I was working on. I don't think I was able to fully to do the lab because I haven't figured out attributes or how to configure my script.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>I am really going to need assistance in section or from my peers because this is really challenging. I would definietly appreciate spending time on this in section because I still don't understand css and callbacks.</p>
