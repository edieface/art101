		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<p> For this lab I worked with Amelia and Kayla on defining objects and arrays in JavaScript.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		 	<p> We worked on getting the JavaScript console on Chrome and then defining our variables. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> Getting the hang of creating arrays and objects was challenging at first, but we eventually figured out how to reference what we were creating.
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> After messing around with arrays and objects I was able to call my arrays from myTransport and myMainRide in the console and I hope it works on the main page.</p>
